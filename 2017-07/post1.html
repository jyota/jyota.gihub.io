I began programming on an old Tandy PC with 5-1/4 inch floppy disks in Basic on MS-DOS. Back then, it was just to try to make games I wanted to play. Then as a teenager, I got to use dial-up internet through my father's employer (a state university) and began learning more about hardware, software, code, and Linux.</p><br><p class="paragraph">Using Linux taught me a lot more about computers than I had known using MS-DOS and Windows. Also, I got to play around in the VAX/VMS environment provided when dialed up to the university. I began learning C programming in Linux to write some 'network utilities' (port scanners, proxy programs, and such). Also, I worked on tile based scrolling games in C. I tried my hand at developing GUI based applications for Windows around this time using C++ and Visual Basic, didn't get very far though.</p><br><p class="paragraph">So it sounds like I'm reminiscing here, and that's true. However, while programming all these things, building and learning about computers, and vaguely aware that 'if I do things certain ways, they are slower than other ways', I never dove into core concepts of computer science, and alas I chose other directions in college to study. I always looked at programming and computers as something I could just do, and it was more of a hobby.</p><br><p class="paragraph">Fast forward to about 6 years ago or so. I didn't really imagine at that point, that I'd end up employed as a software engineer, which is surprising to me because it seemed like it would have been natural for me to get into this field. Anyway, here we are today, and I've done some pretty cool things building software and doing 'data science.' Things that businesses find pretty valuable, I'd say, based on feedback I've gotten. Yet, I still wouldn't say I grasp deeply 'computer science fundamentals.'</p><br><p class="paragraph">What are 'computer science fundamentals?' I've heard it explained as being composed of a lot of things -- complexity theory, to algorithms, compiler design, automatons, etc. All these things I've read enough information about to get by, but now feel driven to learn more about. When I've looked up information about these things or ask colleagues, I hear so many different opinions, it's honestly really confusing. </p><br><p class="paragraph">Some say one really needs the full undergraduate degree in computer science to 'get it.' Another said just read 'Cracking the Coding Interview' and work through the problems in there. Then there a numerous book recommendations: Knuth's 'The Art of Computer Programming' series, Skiena's 'The Algorithm Design Manual', the CLRS 'Introduction to Algorithms', 'Algorithms in a Nutshell' (an O'Reilly book), Sedgewick & Wayne's 'Algorithms', 'The Elements of Computing Systems', Stuarts' 'Understanding Computation', etc. Oh, and don't forget all the possible MOOC or open course lectures one could use to learn these things.</p><br><p class="paragraph">To me, it's information overload to try to decide what is best, especially with so many different answers. I've gotten through graduate school in college, so feel kind of done with the academic route at this point. So I've decided I'll pick from a few of the recommended things that seem likely to help me with where I'm at today, commit to those, and move forward with learning. The following is my self-appointed syllabus -- which I plan to supplement with appropriate lecture videos and other resources as seems useful. </p><ul><li><span><p class="paragraph">Read and do the projects in 'The Elements of Computing Systems'.</p></span></li><li><span><p class="paragraph">Read and work through 'The Algorithm Design Manual'.</p></span></li><li><span><p class="paragraph">Read and work through 'Understanding Computation'.</p></span></li><li><span><p class="paragraph">Read and work through 'The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'.</p></span></li><li><span><p class="paragraph">Read and work through 'Cracking the Coding Interview'.</p></span></li></ul><p class="paragraph">Oh, and I'd already read through Cormen's 'Algorithms Unlocked' as sort of a 'primer' on algorithms a couple months ago. So, my primary goal is to learn hopefully a substantial amount of the computer science fundamentals I may have skipped over to this point in my life and career -- mostly for my own enjoyment and benefit. Although I haven't had any big issues with staying employed in this field so far, my hope is that a beneficial side-effect will be to increase my opportunities to work on interesting problems as a software engineer. <a href="mailto:jyotas@integrated.pro">Let me know</a> if you've got any strong opinions about the approach I'm taking -- or for that matter, tips, warnings, and/or words of encouragement -- all are welcome. </p><br></div><p class="paragraph pager"><a href="/2017-08/post1.html">&laquo; C# IEnumerable & IEnumerator</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/">Top Page</a></p></article><footer class="footer"><p class="right back_to_top"><a href="#">&uArr; Page Top</a></p><p>&copy; Jyota Snyder</p></footer></div><script src="/js/prettify.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/lang-clj.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/main.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
